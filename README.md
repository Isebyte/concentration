Uses Node.js and Socket.io for saving and loading data.

To install Node:
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Do `npm install` to install dependencies need to run.
(if localhost doesn't work try 127.0.0.1:8080))

### Notes:
- Utilized QUnit testing: to run, open test.html (running client side, so no need for node)
- Recommendation: wait until tiles have finished flipping back over before choosing next cards. Refresh if screen hangs.
